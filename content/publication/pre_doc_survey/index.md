abstract: "Participating in a post-undergraduate research experience (e.g., a predoctoral fellowship, full time research assistant position) is becoming increasingly common for incoming PhD students in economics and related fields (Schlauch and Startz 2018). However, often the information on how to get these positions and what they entail is passed only through informal networks. The goal of this survey is to make this information more transparent and widely available."
